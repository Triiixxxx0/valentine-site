  <h1>From My Heart 💗</h1>
  <p>
    These past one and a half months of courting you
    have been meaningful to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every conversation, every moment, and even the
    small things have made me appreciate you more.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even on busy days, you’re someone I think about.
    I may not always show it perfectly, but my feelings
    for you are genuine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you for your patience, your presence,
    and for being you.
  </p>
  <p>
    Happy Valentine’s Day 💖
